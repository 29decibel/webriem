Rails jqGrid
============

This is a rails plugin dedicated to the great jqGrid javascript widget. I had two rails concepts in mind when I created it, "DRY it up" and "Convention over configuration". I managed to get jqGrid to work with two lines of code ( one if you don't count the styling). A standard set of grid options has already been defined, so all you really need to do is give it a model. Enjoy :-)

Usage Instructions:

//For the grid theme
<%= jqgrid_init %>
//For the grid
<%= jqgrid(Model,[optional standard jqGrid options here])) %>

Example 
=======

#index.html

<html>
	<head>
		<%= jqgrid_init) %>
	</head>
	
	<body:>
		
		<%= jqgrid(Log,:fields =>"exercise_type,duration_in_mins,date") %><br/>

	</body>
</html>
