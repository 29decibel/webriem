Rails jqGrid
============

This is a rails plugin dedicated to the great jqGrid javascript widget. I had two rails concepts in mind when I created it, "DRY it up" and "Convention over configuration". I managed to get jqGrid to work with two lines of code ( one if you don't count the styling). A standard set of grid options has already been defined, so all you really need to do is give it a model. Enjoy :-)

Usage Instructions:

//For the grid theme
<%= jqgrid_theme("theme-name") %>
//For the grid
<%= jqgrid(Model,[optional standard jqGrid options here])) %>

Example (The odd HTML is Hobo DRYML)
=======

#index.dryml

<index-page>
	<content-header:>
		<%= jqgrid_theme("pepper-grinder") %>
	</content-header:>
	
	<content-body:>
		
		<%= jqgrid(Log,:fields =>"exercise_type,duration_in_mins,date") %><br/>

	</content-body:>
</index-page>
